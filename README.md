# Hackintosh EFI Config for Asus Q170T Motherboard

View raw = Download

Current supported MacOS Mojave 10.14.6 (Lastest security patch update)

Just extract and put the EFI to your clean EFI partition 

My config: Intel Core i3 8100 / Asus Q170t Motherboard / Samsung 8GB DDR4 2400 Laptop Ram / Intel SSD 5 180GB m2 Sata

What works:

   Intel UHD 630 with both HDMI & Display Port
   Sound (aready layout 7, you may need to try another layout because of to many Lineout output in audio devices)
