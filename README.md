# Hackintosh EFI Config for Asus Q170T Motherboard

View raw = Download

Current supported MacOS Mojave 10.14.6 (Lastest security patch update)

Just extract and put the EFI folder to your clean EFI partition 

### My config: 
```
Intel Core i3 8100
Asus Q170t Motherboard
Samsung 8GB DDR4 2400 Laptop Ram
Intel SSD 5 180GB m2 Sata
```

### What works:
```
Intel UHD 630 with both HDMI & Display Port
Sound (already layout 7, you may need to try another layout like 3 or 5 because of to many Lineout output in audio devices)
Sleep & Wake ( must disable wake on lan and power nap in System Preferences )
Native Power Management (Maybe ? need report)
Both Intel and Realtek LAN
All extenal 3.0 USB Ports
```

### What does not works:
```
Native PM, may work or not, need report.
```

Since this is just a early release, I will looking for contributes from the whole Hackintosh community, and you to fix everything left ;)
